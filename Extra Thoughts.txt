1. What changes you would make to this interfaces for use in an RTOS environment?
- The read and write API can be optionally made a blocking with a timeout parameter and mutex.
- Additionally I2C device can be asynchronous with a callback to notify the completion.
- printf can be removed, a thread safe logging needs to be used.

2. How might the I2C API be improved
- Write and Read combined API can be Implemented.
- Error codes can be extended : OK, Error, Busy etc.
